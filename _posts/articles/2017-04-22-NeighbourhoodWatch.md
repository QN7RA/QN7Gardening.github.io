The Queensland Road Resident's Association has signed up to the Neighbourhood Watch scheme.  As well as reducing crime in the area, the scheme has other benefits, such as reducing the cost of insuring your home.
​
We are working with local officers.  If you are suffering / have suffered from Crime related problems on the road, please contact queenslandroadnhw@gmail.com
​
We are looking for more residents to become representatives of the Neighbourhood Watch.  
​
We are currently trying to come up with better ways to promote and implement this scheme.  If you would like to contribute to the scheme please get in touch!
