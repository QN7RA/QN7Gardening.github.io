Our regular gardening days are held on the **last Sunday of every month from 11am to 1pm**. They’re casual, open to all, and there’s always lots to do around the garden for all ages and abilities. But mostly it’s just an excuse to get together and enjoy the terrace together. Bring a picnic (or cocktail) and pop on down!
