In late 2016 residents were given the green light (and some start-up funding) by Newlon Housing Association to take a more active role in the maintenance and beautification of the communal terrace garden between Tower 1 and Tower 3 Queensland Road.

The QN7 Gardening Club is a casual and informal group of like-minded individuals who meet on the last Sunday of every month to enjoy the terrace, plant, weed and otherwise help keep it growing and looking great for all to enjoy!

All residents of all ages and abilities are invited to [join in the fun](https://qn7gardening.github.io/)!
