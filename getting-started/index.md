## Report a Repair to Newlon

Our regular gardening days are held on the last Sunday of every month from 11am to 1pm. They’re casual, open to all, and there’s always lots to do around the garden for all ages and abilities. But mostly it’s just an excuse to get together and enjoy the terrace together. Bring a picnic (or cocktail) and pop on down!
 
+ Watering & Weeding
+ Pruning flowers & shrubs
+ Harvesting herbs, fruit and vegetables
+ Planting in new bulbs and plants and sowing seeds

## Reporting Anti Social Behaviour to Newlon

The vegetables, herbs and flowers in the tall containers and the low vegetable container will always appreciate extra watering particularly as the terrace is so windy! Join the [current watering rota](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=5EF2B33758F5D52!586&ithint=file%2cxlsx&app=Excel&authkey=!ABfQQDMQ-quGFb0) or if you happen to be down on the terrace there is a water spout on the left handside of the door leading into Tower 1 from the terrace and watering cans of all sizes in the storage box near the low vegetable planter.

## Enjoy the Herb & Veggies

Everything planted on the terrace is there for all to enjoy. For more information on what you might find and how to harvest it see the articles under [Latest News](https://qn7gardening.github.io/articles/).
